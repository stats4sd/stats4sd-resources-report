# Resources Report
This repository is part of our internship programme. For more information about stats4sd please visit https://stats4sd.org/

## Objectives
Stats4SD hosts a large collection of resources to support our project partners around the world (https://stats4sd.org/resources). We would like to develop a lightweight application that will periodically (e.g. weekly/monthly) query the backend database and analytics endpoints, and generate a report of information including:

- Resources added
- Most viewed resources
- Countries of use

The information should be presented as a single web page and be exportable for use in a mailing list.

The project should be carried out over ~4 weeks.

## Technical Specifications
To allow future integration with the main platform it is recommended that the site:
- Uses `vue-js` (v2)
- Styled using `bootstrap` (v4)

You are not required to create a unique design, however do try to follow best practices to make the site as functional as possible. As a bonus you may want to consider adding unit tests. 

## Additional Requirements
This project aims to encourage development of new technical skills as well as good practice for future project work. As such it is encouraged that:
- Code be structured in a logical, modular way
- Code is committed often, should work, and contain clear messages
- Branches are used for different aspects of the code (e.g. new features, bug fixes etc.)
- All code should be reviewed before merging into master. 

## Project Support
Whilst you will be the lead developer on this project, you are encouraged to seek regular support if you have any technical or non-technical problems or questions. You can do this either through direct contact or using the repo `Issues` system (although do send reminders if issues haven't been seen within a day or so).

Code reviews will also be provided weekly (on a Friday), so please try to ensure relevant commits and pull requests are made before then. If you wish to make multiple pull requests during the week to help keep reviews more focused that is also most welcome.
