Despite 30 years of ‘participatory’ research, this label often means farmers not contributing much more than free labour, with researchers doing everything else. \\r\\n\\r\\nWays of making research more participatory have been discussed from an institutional and a social perspective, so these videos focus on the technical issues surrounding truly participatory research. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe discuss the implications of farmers helping to design experiments (for example, by choosing treatments). We also explore ideas on participatory analysis and other activities that farmers can be involved in during the research.",

If you are going to get farmers involved in managing your experiments, they have to be fully involved in each step, and have a feeling of ownership about the process. This is not easy to achieve, but it is possible with good communication. The final webinar in this series focuses specifically on this topic of communication.",
